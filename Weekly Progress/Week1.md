# WEEK 1 (Aug. 27 to Sep. 3, 2023)
## Overview
  The tasks we completed this week are mainly related to the project content, including determining the topic direction and the general content.

## Project Title
  Intelligent Marine buoyancy Platform System

## Project Description
  We want to develop an intelligent offshore buoyancy platform system. The ocean contains a large 
number of renewable resources, and the system will make full use of a variety of renewable resources in 
the ocean to achieve self-power supply at sea, and is expected to achieve a variety of functions such as 
target detection. The system is expected to play a role in offshore farming, Marine pollution monitoring 
and other fields.
  This system will be different from the existing traditional offshore buoy and other institutional design, 
and change the functional form of the device to meet the intelligent system can be self-powered. Thus, the 
design and the structure of the system will be challenging. Our team plans to rely on bionics, and imitate 
existing organisms in nature to design the motion mechanisms. In terms of generation parts, we are going 
to refer to existed tidal power and solar power generation devices to design our power generation 
mechanisms, which will be embedded in the entire platform.
Actually, the most challenging thing we are expected to encounter is the amount and the stability of 
power generated.
  Undoubtedly, the systems will be first designed by aid of CAD, and then conducted on finite element 
analysis (FEA). FEA will show the weaknesses of our initial design, where we can further improve. When 
the design performs well in FEA, the prototype will be fabricated and validated experimentally in the 
pool.
  At the end of the capstone course, our team will provide a physical model of this system, with relevant 
experimental verification and simulation.
