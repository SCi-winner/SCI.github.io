# WEEK 4 (18 September - 24 September, 2023)

## Overview
&emsp;&emsp;We update some parts of our project proposal, including Abstract, Introduction and Problem Statement, as well as Statement of the Goal.
### Abstract
&emsp;&emsp;Marine monitoring equipment is of great significance to the exploitation and utilization of marine resources. However, due to the frequently changing conditions and the inconvenience of signal transmission in the ocean, the traditional marine monitoring equipment is hard to carry out real-time monitoring of the sea conditions in a specific area for a long time. Hence, this project aims to develop an intelligent offshore buoyancy platform system that utilizes renewable resources in the ocean for self-power supply. The expected functionality is the target detection, which can be applied in offshore farming, marine pollution monitoring and etc. Improved from traditional offshore buoys, this device will incorporate two main parts, where the first one is balancing equipment, and the other one is energy harvesting device. The former device is for greater target detection, and the later one will collect the tidal, solar and other forms of power. Furthermore, structural optimization will also be implemented to realize high strengthen and lightweight characteristics. Briefly, the design process will involve CAD modeling, finite element analysis (FEA) to identify weaknesses and areas for improvement, fabrication of a prototype, and experimental validation in a pool. Ultimately, the project will deliver a physical model of the system with supporting experimental verification and simulations.

### Introduction and Problem Statement
&emsp;&emsp;Ocean observation plays a fundamental role in studying and utilizing the ocean, as well as in safeguarding marine rights, developing marine resources, warning against marine disasters, protecting the marine environment, strengthening national defense, and seeking new development opportunities. The ocean holds vast and rich renewable resources, which have great potential in addressing energy demands and various challenges in coastal environments. In this project, our goal is to develop an intelligent offshore buoyancy platform system that harnesses the abundant renewable resources in the ocean. Unlike traditional offshore buoys, this innovative system not only provides self-power generation but also offers advanced functionalities including target detection, support for offshore aquaculture, and monitoring of marine pollution.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Traditional nearshore buoys have limitations in power generation and functionalities. They rely on external power sources and lack the capability to perform complex tasks. Therefore, a new approach is needed to design buoyancy platforms that can overcome these limitations and fulfill the requirements of sustainable energy production and multifunctionality.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;The main objective of this project is to create an intelligent offshore buoyancy platform system that effectively harnesses various renewable resources in the ocean. To achieve this goal, we will draw inspiration from nature and incorporate biomimetic locomotion mechanisms into the design. By mimicking the efficient movements of natural organisms, the platform will be able to navigate flexibly in the ocean and perform targeted detection tasks.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Additionally, the system will support nearshore aquaculture activities by providing a controlled environment for cultivating various marine species. This will contribute to sustainable food production and reduce reliance on traditional land-based cultivation methods. Furthermore, the platform will play a crucial role in marine pollution monitoring by collecting data and analyzing water quality parameters.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Power generation is a key aspect of the proposed system. The challenge lies in generating sufficient and stable electricity to sustain the platform's operation and support its multifunctional capabilities. To address this challenge, we will draw inspiration from existing tidal and solar power generation devices and adapt their principles to design an efficient power generation mechanism that can seamlessly integrate into the buoyancy platform.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;To ensure the success of the project, we will follow a comprehensive design process. We will start with computer-aided design (CAD) modeling to create a detailed virtual representation of the system. This will allow us to optimize the design and identify potential weaknesses before proceeding further. Finite element analysis (FEA) will be employed to simulate the system's performance under various conditions and make corresponding design improvements.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Once the initial design is validated through finite element analysis, a physical prototype will be manufactured. The prototype will undergo extensive experimental testing in controlled pool environments to validate its functionalities, power generation ability, and overall performance. The data collected during the experimental validation stage will provide valuable insights for further refinement and optimization.
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;By the end of the project, our team aims to deliver a physical model of the intelligent offshore buoyancy platform system supported by relevant experimental validations and simulation results. The successful development of this system will pave the way for sustainable energy production, advanced practices in nearshore agriculture, and effective monitoring of marine pollution in the marine environment.

### Introduction and Problem Statement
&emsp;&emsp;The goal of this project is to develop an intelligent offshore buoyancy platform system that utilizes renewable resources in the ocean for self-power supply and accomplishes the function of target detection. The ideal outcome is that the device can realize detection during regular period and the energy harvested can support the self-contained operation of the system.
