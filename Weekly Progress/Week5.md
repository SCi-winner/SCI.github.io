# WEEK 6 (25 September - 1 October, 2023)

## Overview
&emsp;&emsp;We update the project plan of our project proposal.
### Project Plan
Milestone1 : Model designed
<br/>
Task1: Study articles on the mechanics of bionic structures of jellyfish
<br/>
Task2: Study of materials for underwater power supply circuits
<br/>
Task3 : Energy options and utilization patterns
<br/>
Task4 : Learn general head structure and general motor control algorithm
<br/>
Task5 : Research on waterproof and anti-corrosion of PTZ.
<br/>
Task6 : Design Selected Prototype Fabricated
<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Solving of Task1: Studying the jellyfish bionic material, by reading these completed research designs, it can be illustrated from the literature theoretical point of view that the structural model of jellyfish bionic can again help our gimbal to reduce the impact of the sea currents to a certain extent and maintain a certain attitude position. And the research report also gives its practical scenarios and some basic theoretical formulas, finite element analysis, etc., which can help us to better design the jellyfish bionic shape.
<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Solving of Task2: In the study of underwater power transmission I need to take into account the complexity of the underwater situation and the factors affecting it, such as the underwater pressure, the degree of corrosion of seawater, the efficiency of power transmission and the choice of wire materials.
<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Solving of Task3: Our project is a multi-functional integrated platform, which needs to achieve the stabilization of the gimbal and be able to videotape in rough seas. How to cope with complex weather, how to realize surfacing and diving. Whether the array structure is stable, waterproof, and coping with extreme conditions. Energy: Despite the availability of many renewable resources, the forms of energy available to us are still limited, including tidal energy and solar energy. In addition, the mass of components, such as accumulators, should be carefully considered in balance with buoyancy. In addition, the power consumption of electrical equipment needs to be considered
<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Solving of Task4: The basic control of stm32 microcontroller and brushless motor can be carried out from various open source websites. After learning the basic control principle, we first designed a simple PTZ through 3D printing and 3D modeling for testing. Finally, some sensor units are added to the learning, and the sensor feedback is added to the control system to achieve closed-loop control.
<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Solving of Task5: For the current general head has not been able to be used well at sea or in the sea, the reason is that it is difficult to do a good job of waterproofing, preventing water vapor and preventing seawater erosion to improve the service life. In this regard, we can learn by reading some articles about the deck materials of the ship support and some effective waterproof coatings, and we can also choose our best way by purchasing the waterproof materials on the market and conducting experiments.
<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;Solving of Task6:  Solution draft assembly and system diagras.  Consult relevant books to determine the feasibility of the equipment and analyze the balance angle of buoyancy and sinkage
