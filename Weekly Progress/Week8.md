Sen Gao
<br>
Accomplishment:
<br>
1.Completing the previous 3D design sketches for the force feedback structure, the initial purpose of maintaining the balance of the pontoon was largely achieved.
<br>
2.Read articles on ocean waves for marine resource utilization and start designing how to collect and convert ocean wave signals
<br>
Current problems
