# WEEK 3 (11 September - 17 September, 2023)

## Overview
  We did some scientific review and discussed the timeline of the whole work, as well as learning the basic concepts.
## Project Title
**Intelligent Marine buoyancy Platform System**

## Project Description
Last week, our group has discussed the timeline of the whole work. Our members did the scientific review
with respect to our own parts. Besides, we are learning the concepts necessary for our part design and fabrication.

1. Part of Fang, Zhenyu: I have reviewed some marine devices published in the last few years. Since my idea is to utilize
triboelectricity and wave energy, I have completed the fundamental devices to realize the function. However, in order to design
the whole device, I continue to search for existed devices and designs.

2. Part of Zhou, Jifeng: This week, I conducted a preliminary study of the head head.
I looked up the relevant parts of the mobile phone head and camera head on the Internet.
After the study, I found that this structure is not suitable for the wave shake prevention on the sea surface,
and our team is not particularly familiar with the motor control.

3. Part of Zhangï¼ŒXinyue: Origami structure and metamaterial have become the research frontiers and hot spots in mathematics,
physics and engineering because of their infinite design space, outstanding variable shape, variable size, variable topological properties,
and supernormal mechanical properties induced by folding. The dynamics of origami structures and metamaterials are becoming more and more prominent,
involving not only dynamic modeling and parameter identification, but also dynamic mechanism analysis and experimental testing.
The complex spatial geometric relations, rich deformation modes and globally strong nonlinear constitutive
relations induced by folding bring many new challenges and opportunities to the study of dynamics.
Recent progress in the study of origami structure and metamaterial dynamics, including :(1) dynamic modeling and parameter identification methods; (2) Dynamic theory, finite element and experimental analysis methods; (3) Folding induced dynamic behavior, including bistable and multistable dynamic behavior, transient dynamic behavior and wave propagation dynamic behavior; (4) Typical kinetic applications.
Related directions to learn: origami structure; Origami metamaterial; Dynamic modeling; Folding dynamics; Multisteady state dynamics; Transient dynamics; Wave mechanics

5. Part of Zhang, Jiaheng: I have a better understanding of my task. It can be seen that this topic has a greater
role in the comprehensive application of my theoretical knowledge and skills, and requires that we must
have a solid foundation of parts design, have a comprehensive mechanical professional knowledge, familiar
with mechanical principles and other professional knowledgeThe relevant books are "Mechanical Manufacturing
Testing Technology Manual", and the relevant picture books are also borrowed. Then read the relevant materials
and borrowed books to get ready for the design

6. Part of Gao, Sen: This week I've been reading up on jellyfish bionics and maintaining force balance,
and have a rough plan for the part I'm designing. I got some understanding and preliminary design for
the wiring and the adjustment of the gimbal's attitude, designed a rough sketch, and prepared to do
some simple mechanical analysis in the next step. After that, I carried out some simulation analysis
to support the stability of my mechanical structure with theoretical data. I hope to discuss with the
teacher to help me realize the next step of mechanical theory analysis and simulation modeling.
