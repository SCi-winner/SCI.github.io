## Overview
  We did some scientific review and discussed the timeline of the whole work, as well as learning the basic concepts.
## Project Title
**Intelligent Marine buoyancy Platform System**

## Project Description
Last week, our group has discussed the timeline of the whole work. Our members did the scientific review
with respect to our own parts. Besides, we are learning the concepts necessary for our part design and fabrication.

1. Part of Fang, Zhenyu: I have reviewed some marine devices published in the last few years. Since my idea is to utilize
triboelectricity and wave energy, I have completed the fundamental devices to realize the function. However, in order to design
the whole device, I continue to search for existed devices and designs.

2. Part of Zhou, Jifeng: This week, I conducted a preliminary study of the head head.
I looked up the relevant parts of the mobile phone head and camera head on the Internet.
After the study, I found that this structure is not suitable for the wave shake prevention on the sea surface,
and our team is not particularly familiar with the motor control.

3. Part of Zhangï¼ŒXinyue: I have a preliminary idea and design for the light storage rechargeable battery, 
I think we need solar panels, solar panels dedicated voltage regulator module, lithium batteries. If you want to 
add the function of automatic intelligent light chasing, you have to add a microcontroller (can use stm32c8t6 ), 
photoresistor, stepping motor, and 3.3v voltage conversion chip (can use rt6150b-33gqw).Ordinary buck regulator
module can also be achieved, to ensure that the power supply will not be lower than 5v can be.Function part can 
also add a display to show the current power, light intensity, temperature, sun angle and so on. If necessary,
you can also add buttons to control the menu and so on. You can also add a LED, light off and no lighton. You can
also add bluetooth or WiFi module, and develop an APP or oc program, so that the data uploaded in real time display.
The above functions are all part of the idea, currently there is a need for additional structure and then realise
the functions other than energy storage.

4. Part of Zhang, Jiaheng: I have a better understanding of my task. It can be seen that this topic has a greater
role in the comprehensive application of my theoretical knowledge and skills, and requires that we must
have a solid foundation of parts design, have a comprehensive mechanical professional knowledge, familiar
with mechanical principles and other professional knowledgeThe relevant books are "Mechanical Manufacturing
Testing Technology Manual", and the relevant picture books are also borrowed. Then read the relevant materials
and borrowed books to get ready for the design

5. Part of Gao, Sen: This week I've been reading up on jellyfish bionics and maintaining force balance,
and have a rough plan for the part I'm designing. I got some understanding and preliminary design for
the wiring and the adjustment of the gimbal's attitude, designed a rough sketch, and prepared to do
some simple mechanical analysis in the next step. After that, I carried out some simulation analysis
to support the stability of my mechanical structure with theoretical data. I hope to discuss with the
teacher to help me realize the next step of mechanical theory analysis and simulation modeling.
